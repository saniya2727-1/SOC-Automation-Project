# SOC Automation Project

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The SOC Automation Lab project aimed to build a simulated Security Operations Center (SOC) using open-source tools. The objective was to ingest Windows logs, detect malicious activity, and automate responses through a SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platform. The project helped reinforce knowledge in log analysis, security automation, and case management workflows.

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Hands-on experience with SIEM and SOAR tools in a SOC workflow
- Implemented automated alert triage and enrichment using Shuffle SOAR
- Investigated malicious activity using Wazuh alerts
- Created and managed security cases using TheHive
- Improved ability to interpret Windows event logs and Sysmon data
- Developed troubleshooting and log correlation techniques across multiple platforms



### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Wazuh â€“ for log analysis, alerting, and rule-based detections
- Sysmon â€“ for detailed Windows event telemetry (processes, network, registry)
- Shuffle SOAR â€“ for building automated workflows in response to alerts
- TheHive â€“ for managing security incidents as cases
- Elasticsearch - for storing and visualizing logs and alerts
- Ubuntu â€“ for deploying all SOC components in a lab environment

## Steps

ðŸ“Œ This diagram outlines the end-to-end flow of logs and alerts from the Windows endpoint to Wazuh and Elasticsearch, with automated responses triggered via Shuffle and case management handled in TheHive.

ðŸ“Œ This diagram shows the automated alert handling workflow built in Shuffle. It starts with a Wazuh webhook, extracts file hashes, queries VirusTotal, creates a case in TheHive, and sends an alert summary via email.

ðŸ“Œ This step parses the SHA256 hash from the Wazuh alert payload to use in enrichment.

ðŸ“Œ Automates IOC enrichment using VirusTotal API for file hash reputation.

ðŸ“Œ This alert in Wazuh shows detection of suspicious process creation, including a Mimikatz-related command, parsed from Sysmon logs.

ðŸ“Œ Cases in TheHive are populated with alert data and linked observables. Analysts can assign severity, track investigation, and launch Cortex analyzers.

ðŸ“Œ Configured alert forwarding in Wazuh to automatically send high-priority security alerts via email for real-time notification and incident awareness.
