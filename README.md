# SOC Automation Project

## Objective

The SOC Automation Lab project aimed to build a simulated Security Operations Center (SOC) using open-source tools. The objective was to ingest Windows logs, detect malicious activity, and automate responses through a SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platform. The project helped reinforce knowledge in log analysis, security automation, and case management workflows.

### Skills Learned

- Hands-on experience with SIEM and SOAR tools in a SOC workflow
- Implemented automated alert triage and enrichment using Shuffle SOAR
- Investigated malicious activity using Wazuh alerts
- Created and managed security cases using TheHive
- Improved ability to interpret Windows event logs and Sysmon data
- Developed troubleshooting and log correlation techniques across multiple platforms



### Tools Used

- Wazuh – for log analysis, alerting, and rule-based detections
- Sysmon – for detailed Windows event telemetry (processes, network, registry)
- Shuffle SOAR – for building automated workflows in response to alerts
- TheHive – for managing security incidents as cases



## Steps

The architecture begins with a Windows endpoint running Sysmon, which logs events such as process creations and network connections. These logs are forwarded to Wazuh, which processes and evaluates them against detection rules. Alerts are sent to Shuffle via webhook, where hashes are extracted and enriched via VirusTotal. The enriched results are sent to TheHive for case management, and high-severity alerts are also forwarded via email.

📌 This diagram outlines the end-to-end flow of logs and alerts from the Windows endpoint to Wazuh, with automated responses triggered via Shuffle and case management handled in TheHive.

📌 This diagram shows the automated alert handling workflow built in Shuffle. It starts with a Wazuh webhook, extracts file hashes, queries VirusTotal, creates a case in TheHive, and sends an alert summary via email.

📌 The Wazuh rule that triggered the alert was configured to detect credential dumping techniques using Mimikatz.

📌 This step parses the SHA256 hash from the Wazuh alert payload using the following regular expression:

📌 Automates IOC enrichment using VirusTotal API for file hash reputation.

📌 Cases in TheHive are populated with alert data and linked observables. Analysts can assign severity and track investigation.

📌 Configured alert forwarding in Wazuh to automatically send high-priority security alerts via email for real-time notification and incident awareness.

📌 This case was automatically created in TheHive after Wazuh detected the execution of a Mimikatz payload (iamawesome.exe) on the Windows endpoint.

The alert was enriched via Shuffle SOAR, tagged with MITRE ATT&CK technique T1003 (Credential Dumping), and assigned a severity level of Medium.

The command line, process ID, and host were all extracted and included in the case summary to provide full context to the analyst.


## 🧩 Real-World Relevance & Cybersecurity Frameworks

This scenario demonstrates real-world detection of credential harvesting using open-source tools and automation.

### 📌 MITRE ATT&CK Alignment

This project simulates **Credential Dumping** using Mimikatz (`iamawesome.exe`), a tactic frequently used by adversaries to escalate privileges and extract credentials from memory. The detection and automation in this lab align with the MITRE ATT&CK technique:

- **T1003 – Credential Dumping**: Triggered by Mimikatz behavior detected by Wazuh

### 🔐 NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

This lab reflects real-world SOC operations and maps directly to the following **NIST CSF** core functions:

| CSF Function | Example from Project |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **Identify** | Configured monitored assets (Sysmon, Wazuh) and detection rules |
| **Detect**   | Alerts generated in Wazuh for suspicious credential dumping |
| **Respond**  | Automation using Shuffle SOAR and case creation in TheHive |
| **Recover**  | Alert forwarding via email to simulate escalation workflows |
